Doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine injection are not to exceed 60 mg (total dose per day) in these patients.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nKetorolac Tromethamine Tablets\n\u2022 Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets are indicated only as continuation therapy to Ketorolac Tromethamine injection, and the combined duration of use of Ketorolac Tromethamine injection and Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 (five) days, because of the increased risk of serious adverse events.\n\u2022 The recommended total daily dose of Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets (maximum 40 mg) is significantly lower than for Ketorolac Tromethamine injection (maximum 120 mg) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).\nKetorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP is a member of the pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The chemical name for Ketorolac Tromethamine is (\u00b1)-5-benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (1:1), and the structural formula is presented in Figure 1.\nKetorolac Tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S and [+]R Ketorolac Tromethamine. Ketorolac Tromethamine may exist in three crystal forms. All forms are equally soluble in water. Ketorolac Tromethamine has a pKa of 3.5 and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 0.26. The molecular weight of Ketorolac Tromethamine is 376.40.\nKetorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP is available for intramuscular (IM) administration as: 60 mg in 2 mL (3%) of Ketorolac Tromethamine in sterile solution - for intramuscular administration only. The solutions contain 10% (w/v) alcohol, USP, and 8.70 mg, of sodium chloride in sterile water. The pH range is 6.9 to 7.9 and is adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. The sterile solutions are clear and slightly yellow in color.\nKetorolac Tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of action of ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of Ketorolac Tromethamine is associated with the S-form.\nKetorolac Tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties.\nThe peak analgesic effect of Ketorolac Tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of Ketorolac Tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine by either route is in the duration of analgesia.\nKetorolac Tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models.

In adults, the extent of bioavailability following administration of the ORAL and INTRAMUSCULAR forms of Ketorolac Tromethamine was equal to that following an INTRAVENOUS bolus.\nLinear Kinetics\nIn adults, following administration of single ORAL, INTRAMUSCULAR or INTRAVENOUS doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine in the recommended dosage ranges, the clearance of the racemate does not change. This implies that the pharmacokinetics of Ketorolac Tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple intramuscular, intravenous or recommended oral doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate.\nDistribution\nThe mean apparent volume (V\u03b2) of Ketorolac Tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The Ketorolac Tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations.\nKetorolac Tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Nursing Mothers)\nMetabolism\nKetorolac Tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine.\nExcretion\nThe principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg Ketorolac Tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately two times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired patients is outlined in Table 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u2013 Kinetics in Special Populations).\nThe half-life of the Ketorolac Tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD \u00b1 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD \u00b1 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.\nAccumulation\nKetorolac Tromethamine administered as an intravenous bolus, every 6 hours, for 5 days, to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in Cmax on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD \u00b1 0.23) on Day 6. Steady state was approached after the fourth dose.\nAccumulation of Ketorolac Tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure patients, or hepatic disease patients).\nKinetics in Special Populations\nGeriatric Patients\nBased on single-dose data only, the half-life of the Ketorolac Tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see Table 2). There was little difference in the Cmax for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL \u00b1 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL \u00b1 1.03) (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Geriatric Use).\nPediatric Patients\nLimited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8 \u00b1 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 \u00b1 0.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V\u03b2) was 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 0.26 \u00b1 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects (see Table 1). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of Ketorolac Tromethamine by the intramuscular route in pediatric patients.\nRenal Insufficiency\nBased on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of Ketorolac Tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours, and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total Ketorolac Tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).\nIn patients with renal disease, the AUC\u221e of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of Ketorolac Tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction.\nThe AUC\u221e- ratio of the Ketorolac Tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects (see WARNINGS \u2013 Renal Effects).\nHepatic Insufficiency\nThere was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC\u221e and Cmax, in 7 patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Hepatic Effects and Table 2).\nRace\nPharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.\n.\nIntravenous -Administration: In normal subjects (n=37), the total clearance of 30 mg intravenous-administered Ketorolac Tromethamine was 0.030 (0.017-0.051) L/h/kg. The terminal half-life was 5.6 (4.0-7.9) hours. (See Kinetics in Special Populations for use of intravenous dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine in pediatric patients.)\nAdult Patients\nIn a postoperative study, where all patients received morphine by a PCA device, patients treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine intravenous as fixed intermittent boluses (e.g., 30 mg initial dose followed by 15 mg q3h), required significantly less morphine (26%) than the placebo group. Analgesia was significantly superior, at various postdosing pain assessment times, in the patients receiving Ketorolac Tromethamine intravenous plus PCA morphine as compared to patients receiving PCA-administered morphine alone.\nCarefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Ketorolac Tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).\nAcute Pain in Adult Patients\nKetorolac Tromethamine is indicated for the short-term (\u22645 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be initiated with intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine, and oral Ketorolac Tromethamine is to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of Ketorolac Tromethamine injection and oral Ketorolac Tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but Ketorolac Tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.\n(see also Boxed WARNING)\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to Ketorolac Tromethamine.\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.\nKetorolac Tromethamine should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylacticlike reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS \u2013 Anaphylactoid Reactions, and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pre-existing Asthma).\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery. In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS).\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion (see WARNINGS for correction of volume depletion).\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine musculature, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage.\nKetorolac Tromethamine inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.\nThe concomitant use of Ketorolac Tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.\nThe concomitant use of Ketorolac Tromethamine and pentoxifylline is contraindicated.\nKetorolac Tromethamine injection is contraindicated for neuraxial (epidural or intrathecal) administration due to its alcohol content.\n(See also Boxed WARNING.)\nThe total combined duration of use of oral Ketorolac Tromethamine and intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac Tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.\nThe most serious risks associated with Ketorolac Tromethamine are:\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal Effects \u2013 Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation: Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously documented peptic ulcers and/ or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Ketorolac Tromethamine can cause serious GI adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine.\nOnly one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy.\nThe incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with Ketorolac Tromethamine. Do not use Ketorolac Tromethamine formore than five days.\nHowever, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of Ketorolac Tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\nNSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.\nHemorrhage\nBecause prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding complications if given Ketorolac Tromethamine concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of Ketorolac Tromethamine and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2500-5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks, and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.\nIn postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the peri-operative use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine. Therefore, peri-operative use of Ketorolac Tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS).\nRenal Effects\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usuallyfollowed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\nKetorolac Tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, Ketorolac Tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.\nImpaired Renal Function\nKetorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac Tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving Ketorolac Tromethamine to these patients.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions\nAs with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to Ketorolac Tromethamine. Ketorolac Tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS - Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.\nCardiovascular Effects\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events\nClinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first few weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID- treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as Ketorolac Tromethamine, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).\nStatus Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery\nTwo large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG surgery (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).\nPost-MI Patients\nObservational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post- MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years follow-up.\nAvoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ketorolac Tromethamine is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.\nHypertension\nNSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\nHeart Failure and Edema\nThe Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID- treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.\nAdditionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of Ketorolac Tromethamine may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).\nAvoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Ketorolac Tromethamine is used inpatients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.\nSkin Reactions\nNSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\nPregnancy\nIn late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, Ketorolac Tromethamine should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus\nGeneral\nKetorolac Tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\nThe pharmacological activity of Ketorolac Tromethamine in reducing inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHepatic Effects\nKetorolac Tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Ketorolac Tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.\nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Ketorolac Tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Ketorolac Tromethamine should be discontinued.\nHematologic Effects\nAnemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs orsymptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving Ketorolac Tromethamine who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.\nPre-existing Asthma\nPatients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Ketorolac Tromethamine should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing asthma.\nInformation for Patients\nKetorolac Tromethamine is a potent NSAID and may cause serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney failure, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome.\nPhysicians, when prescribing Ketorolac Tromethamine, should inform their patients or their guardians of the potential risks of Ketorolac Tromethamine treatment (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if they develop treatment-related adverse events, and advise patients not to give oral Ketorolac Tromethamine to other family members and to discard any unused drug. Remember that the total combined duration of use of oral Ketorolac Tromethamine and intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac Tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.\n1. Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS).\n2. Ketorolac Tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).\n3. Ketorolac Tromethamine, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signsand symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.\n4. Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).\n5. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.\n6. Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).\n7. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, Ketorolac Tromethamine should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\nLaboratory Tests\nBecause serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, Ketorolac Tromethamine should be discontinued.\nDrug Interactions\nKetorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%). There is no evidence in animal or human studies that Ketorolac Tromethamine induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.\nWarfarin, Digoxin, Salicylate, and Heparin\nThe in vitro binding of warfarin to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by Ketorolac Tromethamine (99.5% control vs 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL. Ketorolac does not alter digoxin protein binding. In vitro studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin and tolbutamide did not alter Ketorolac Tromethamine protein binding.\nIn a study involving 12 adult volunteers, oral Ketorolac Tromethamine was coadministered with a single dose of 25 mg warfarin, causing no significant changes in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. In another study, Ketorolac Tromethamine dosed intravenous or intramuscular was given with two doses of 5000 U of heparin to 11 healthy volunteers, resulting in a mean template bleeding time of 6 minutes (3.2 to 11.4 min) compared to a mean of 6.0 minutes (3.4 to 7.5 min) for heparin alone and 5.1 minutes (3.5 to 8.5 min) for placebo. Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between Ketorolac Tromethamine and warfarin or heparin, the administration of Ketorolac Tromethamine to patients taking anticoagulants should be done extremely cautiously and patients should be closely monitored (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Hematologic Effects).\nThe effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.\nAspirin\nWhen Ketorolac Tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free Ketorolac Tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of Ketorolac Tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.\nDiuretics\nClinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that Ketorolac Tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS \u2013 Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.\nProbenecid\nConcomitant administration of oral Ketorolac Tromethamine and probenecid resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of Ketorolac Tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.\nLithium\nNSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.\nMethotrexate\nNSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.\nACE Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists\nConcomitant use of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists may increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.\nReports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nAntiepileptic Drugs\nSporadic cases of seizures have been reported during concomitant use of Ketorolac Tromethamine and antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine).\nPsychoactive Drugs\nHallucinations have been reported when Ketorolac Tromethamine was used in patients taking psychoactive drugs (fluoxetine, thiothixene, alprazolam).\nPentoxifylline\nWhen Ketorolac Tromethamine is administered concurrently with pentoxifylline, there is an increased tendency to bleeding.\nNondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants\nIn postmarketing experience there have been reports of a possible interaction between Ketorolac Tromethamine intravenous/intramuscular and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that resulted in apnea. The concurrent use of Ketorolac Tromethamine with muscle relaxants has not been formally studied.\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)\nThere is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are combined with NSAIDs. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with SSRIs.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility\nAn 18-month study in mice with oral doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets at 2 mg/kg/day (0.9 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended intramuscular or intravenous dose of 30 mg qid, based on area-under-the-plasma-concentration curve [AUC]), and a 24-month study in rats at 5 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the human AUC) showed no evidence of tumorigenicity.\nKetorolac Tromethamine was not mutagenic in the Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair, and in forward mutation assays. Ketorolac Tromethamine did not cause chromosome breakage in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. At 1590 mcg/mL and at higher concentrations, Ketorolac Tromethamine increased the incidence of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian cells.\nImpairment of fertility did not occur in male or female rats at oral doses of 9 mg/kg (0.9 times the human AUC) and 16 mg/kg (1.6 times the human AUC) of Ketorolac Tromethamine, respectively.\nPregnancy\nTeratogenic Effects\nPregnancy Category C\nReproduction studies have been performed during organogenesis using daily oral doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets at 3.6 mg/kg (0.37 times the human AUC) in rabbits and at 10 mg/kg (1.0 times the human AUC) in rats. Results of these studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity to the fetus. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.\nNonteratogenic Effects\nBecause of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Oral doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered after gestation day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats.\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Ketorolac Tromethamine in pregnant women. Ketorolac Tromethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nLabor and Delivery\nThe use of Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).\nEffects on Fertility\nThe use of Ketorolac Tromethamine, as with any drug known to inhibit cyclooxygenase/ prostaglandin synthesis, may impair fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulty conceiving or are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of Ketorolac Tromethamine should be considered.\nNursing Mothers\nLimited data from one published study that included 10 breastfeeding women 2-6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk and were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg of Ketorolac Tromethamine, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400-1,000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.\nExercise caution when ketorolac is administered to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant\u2019s healthcare provider if they note any adverse events.\nPediatric Use\nKetorolac Tromethamine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Ketorolac Tromethamine in pediatric patients below the age of 17 have not been established.\nGeriatric Use (\u226565 Years of Age)\nBecause Ketorolac Tromethamine may be cleared more slowly by the elderly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY) who are also more sensitive to the dose-related adverse effects of NSAIDs (see WARNINGS \u2013 Gastrointestinal Effects \u2013 Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation), extreme caution and reduced dosages (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and careful clinical monitoring must be used when treating the elderly with Ketorolac Tromethamine.\nAdverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of Ketorolac Tromethamine. Practitioners should be alert for the severe complications of treatment with Ketorolac Tromethamine, such as G.I. ulceration, bleeding and perforation, postoperative bleeding, acute renal failure, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and liver failure (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These NSAID-related complications can be serious in certain patients for whom Ketorolac Tromethamine is indicated, especially when the drug is used inappropriately.\nIn patients taking Ketorolac Tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:\nAdditional adverse experiences reported occasionally (<1% in patients taking Ketorolac Tromethamine or other NSAIDs in clinical trials) include:\nBody as a Whole: fever, infections, sepsis\nCardiovascular: congestive heart failure, palpitation, pallor, tachycardia, syncope\nDermatologic: alopecia, photosensitivity, urticaria\nGastrointestinal: anorexia, dry mouth, eructation, esophagitis, excessive thirst, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, hepatitis, increased appetite, jaundice, melena, rectal bleeding\nHemic and Lymphatic: ecchymosis, eosinophilia, epistaxis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia\nMetabolic and Nutritional: weight change\nNervous System: abnormal dreams, abnormal thinking, anxiety, asthenia, confusion, depression, euphoria, extrapyramidal symptoms, hallucinations, hyperkinesis, inability to concentrate, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, stupor, tremors, vertigo, malaise\nReproductive, female: infertility\nRespiratory: asthma, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, rhinitis\nSpecial Senses: abnormal taste, abnormal vision, blurred vision, hearing loss\nUrogenital: cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, increased urinary frequency, interstitial nephritis, oliguria/ polyuria, proteinuria, renal failure, urinary retention\nOther rarely observed reactions (reported from postmarketing experience in patients taking Ketorolac Tromethamine or other NSAIDs) are:\nBody as a Whole: angioedema, death, hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction, laryngeal edema, tongue edema (see WARNINGS), myalgia\nCardiovascular: arrhythmia, bradycardia, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, myocardial infarction, vasculitis\nDermatologic: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Lyell\u2019s syndrome, bullous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis\nGastrointestinal: acute pancreatitis, liver failure, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease)\nHemic and Lymphatic: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, post operative wound hemorrhage (rarely requiring blood transfusion \u2014 see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS)\nMetabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia\nNervous System: aseptic meningitis, convulsions, coma, psychosis\nRespiratory: bronchospasm, respiratory depression, pneumonia\nSpecial Senses: conjunctivitis\nUrogenital: flank pain with or without hematuria and/or azotemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome\nPostmarketing Surveillance Study\nA large postmarketing observational, nonrandomized study, involving approximately 10,000 patients receiving Ketorolac Tromethamine, demonstrated that the risk of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose-dependent (see Tables 3A and 3B). This was particularly true in elderly patients who received an average daily dose greater than 60 mg/day of Ketorolac Tromethamine (see Table 3A)\nSymptoms and Signs\nSymptoms following acute NSAIDs overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.\nTreatment\nPatients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following a NSAIDs overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 g to 100 g in adults, 1 g/kg to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large oral overdose (5 to 10 times the usual dose). Forced diuresis, alkalization of urine, hemodialysis or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\nSingle overdoses of Ketorolac Tromethamine have been variously associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or erosive gastritis and renal dysfunction which have resolved after discontinuation of dosing.\nCarefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Ketorolac Tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use Ketorolac Tromethamine. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. In adults, the combined duration of use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine and oral Ketorolac Tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days. In adults, the use of oral Ketorolac Tromethamine is only indicated as continuation therapy to intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine. See package insert for Ketorolac Tromethamine tablets for transition from intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine (single- or multiple-dose) to multiple-dose oral Ketorolac Tromethamine.\nNote: Oral formulation should not be given as an initial dose.\nUse minimum effective dose for the individual patient.\nTotal duration of treatment in adult patients: the combined duration of use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of Ketorolac Tromethamine and oral Ketorolac Tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days.\nKetorolac Tromethamine INJECTION\nKetorolac Tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or \u201cprn\u201d schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the administration of Ketorolac Tromethamine (see WARNINGS \u2013 Renal Effects). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but Ketorolac Tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.\nWhen administering Ketorolac Tromethamine injection, the intravenous bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The intramuscular administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing intravenous or intramuscular. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.\nSingle-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only\nIntramuscular Dosing\n\u2022 Patients <65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.\n\u2022 Patients \u226565 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.\nIntravenous Dosing\n\u2022 Patients <65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.\n\u2022 Patients \u226565 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.\nMultiple-Dose Treatment (Intravenous or Intramuscular)\n\u2022 Patients <65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg Ketorolac Tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg.\n\u2022 For patients \u226565 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg Ketorolac Tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.\nFor breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of Ketorolac Tromethamine. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids \u201cprn\u201d unless otherwise contraindicated.\nPharmaceutical Information for Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection\nKetorolac Tromethamine injection should not be mixed in a small volume (e.g., in a syringe) with morphine sulfate, meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride or hydroxyzine hydrochloride; this will result in precipitation of ketorolac from solution.\nNOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\nKetorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP is supplied as follows:\nNDC Number Container Description Concentration (mg/mL) Fill Volume/ Container Size Total Ketorolac Tromethamine (Per Container)\n*0487-6232-01 (Carton of 30 single dose luer-lock vials) Single-dose plastic luer-lock vial 30 mg/ mL 2 mL/ 3mL 60 mg\n*FOR INTRAMUSCULAR USE ONLY.\nEach vial is made from a polypropylene (PP) resin.\nEach carton contains 30 single-dose luer-lock vials.\nStore at 20 to 25\u00baC (68 to 77\u00baF) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]\nProtect from light.\nRetain in carton until time of use.\nNephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation, 4500 12th Street Extension, West Columbia, SC 29172 USA\n\nIC # 2080 Rev AUG 2020\nManufactured by:\nNephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation\nWest Columbia, SC 29172\n1-800-443-4313", "Ketorolac ophthalmic": "Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.\nKetorolac ophthalmic (for the eye) is used to relieve eye itching caused by seasonal allergies.\nKetorolac ophthalmic is also used to reduce swelling, pain, and burning or stinging after cataract surgery or corneal refractive surgery.\nKetorolac ophthalmic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.", "Ketotifen": "Ketotifen is a type of asthma medication which, when taken every day and used along with other antiasthma medications, may reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of asthma symptoms or attacks in children.
